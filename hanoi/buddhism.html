                    <p>As a Vietnamese person, I was so excited to finally visit the country of my heritage. I made a
                        plan to travel around Northern and Southern Vietnam to experience the different cultures and
                        scenery for two weeks. I would mostly stay around Hương Sơn in Hanoi, though. One of my final
                        destinations would be the Hương Temple complex there, where I was joined by my now-friend, Kiều.
                    </p>

                    <p class="caption">
                        <caption>Kiều and I boating with a friend.</caption>
                    </p>
                    <p>Coming to Vietnam for the first time was so fun! It was very different from where I was born but
                        it's a good kind of difference. It was like discovering a new part of my identity that I never
                        really was able to see.</p>
                    <p>The main form of travel was motorbike. Getting used to crossing the road with people still
                        driving was tough! Make sure to secure all your belongings as some of the drivers may zoom by
                        the road and take them! Eating traditional Vietnamese food in the country itself was a unique
                        experience. I was surprised with the price compared to the quality. I went to <a
                            href="http://www.phole.vn/">Phở Lệ</a> in Ho Chi Minh City per reviews online and for only
                        60K VND (3.45 CAD, which is a bit more on the expensive side in Vietnam but still), I got a
                        phenomenal-tasting bowl of phở!
                    </p>
                    <img src="../img/pho-le.jpg" alt="A bowl of phở">

                        <caption>Eating some phở.</caption>
                    </p>
                    <p>I had some trouble understanding Vietnamese people in the North due to the difference in dialect,
                        but that did not stop me from making acquaintances there. Up in Hương, I met Kiều Bùi, who would
                        help guide me through the religion of Buddhism. She also helped me get used to the Northern
                        Vietnamese dialect (thank goodness!).</p>
                    <h3 class="post-heading">
                        Meet Kiều Bùi
                    </h3>
                    <p>Kiều is a third year student at Hà Tĩnh University, majoring in the Arts. Her father's side is
                        Christian while her mother's is Buddhist. She herself practices Buddhism. Kiều takes a large
                        interest in religious art, occasionally travelling around the world to view and analyze various
                        pieces of art, although her favourite place is still the Vietnam National Fine Arts Museum.
                        She's an amazing painter as well. If you are around Hanoi, please visit her art shop!</p>

                    <h3 class="post-heading">
                        Creed
                    </h3>
                    <p>Kiều practices <i>Mahayana Buddhism</i>, one of the two main divisions of Buddhism. The other
                        division, being <i>Theravada Buddhism</i>, is more traditional, with many being monks or nuns.
                        Kiều showed a necklace that she was gifted that represented the Three Jewels of Buddhism, which
                        guide
                        the central beliefs of a Buddhist: Buddha, <i>dharma</i> and <i>sangha</i>, which was quite
                        surprising as I expected some type of longer creed like the Apostles Creed. Dharma was
                        familiar to me from Hinduism, demonstrating how closely related both religions are, Buddhism
                        being developed from Hinduism.</p>

                    <p>The first jewel is Buddha, the teacher, which shows how we can
                        do the same as Buddha to represent how us too can reach enlightenment. The Buddha teaches that
                        people can break out of the cycle of reincarnation by becoming enlightened, reaching the state
                        of <i>nirvana</i>. By following these teachings, Kiều hopes to become enlightened. </p>
                    <p>The second is dharma, which are the teachings of Buddha. Kiều gave me the main ones, which
                        included:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Three Jewels</li>
                        <li>The Three Universal Truths</li>
                        <li>The Four Noble Truths</li>
                        <li>The Noble Eightfold Path</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The last was sangha, the Buddhist community. One's community can help the individual
                        through their spiritual journey. This includes people like teachers and even
                        <i>Bodhisattvas</i>, Buddhists who have reached enlightenment but choose to stay in
                        reincarnation to help others reach it too. Mahayana Buddhists like Kiều may choose to remain in
                        reincarnation while Theravada Buddhists strive for freedom.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../img/maitreya.jpg" alt="A golden Buddhist statue">
                    <p class="caption">
                        <caption>Maitreya, a Bodhisattva.</caption>
                    </p>
                    <p>There's a huge green statue of the Buddha in there along with a plethora of others. Every temple
                        there had a statue of the Buddha somewhere. As well, there were candles and the smell of incense
                        present—brings me back to some family gatherings. We stopped last at the Thiên Trù Pagoda, which
                        is the central temple of the complex, where I observed people worshipping. Most people here who
                        were doing so were silently meditating. Some made offerings which represented showing respect to
                        the Three Jewels. They would light incense, light a candle then give an offering of some sort of
                        fruit or flowers. Kiều made a big distinction to me, however, that Buddhists do not worship
                        Buddha, nor any other deities. This is different from Christianity where one would worship God.
                        Buddhists only highly regard Buddha and follow his teachings.</p>
                    <h3 class="post-heading">
                        Code
                    </h3>
                    <p>Kiều explained that there really isn't one holy book, like the Bible, that contains all Mahayana
                        beliefs, her branch accepting a variety of different texts of a variety of genres. Kiều gifted
                        me a copy of the Jatakas, a rather humourous collection of the former lives of the Buddha, which
                        serves to illustrate the life of a Bodhisattva. To save me from having to read millions of words
                        in order to uncover the principles of Buddhism, Kiều summarized it to me over a dinner (bless
                        her soul, thank you so much). She introduced me to the Five Precepts:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Refraining from harming the living, hence why she is vegetarian. The dinner was vegetarian too, and it tasted delicious.
                        </li>
                        <li>Avoiding stealing</li>
                        <li>Avoiding sexual misconduct </li>
                        <li>Refraining from using false speech, such as lying</li>
                        <li>Refraining from using false speech, such as lying</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As a reform Jew herself, Shira does not literally follow all these laws, rather adapting them to
                        her present life. Hasidic Jews, however, follow the Torah exactly. A large population of them
                        live around this area in Greenpoint. Shira pointed out to me their clothing as an external
                        example of their way of living. Women are only seen wearing modest dresses. The men are all
                        wearing black suits with a kippot, <dfn title="A cylindrical fur hat">shtreimel</dfn> or a black
                        hat.</p>

                        Cult
                    </h3>
                    <p>I went with Kiều on the weekend to the Hương Temple complex. According to legend, this temple was
                        discovered by a monk who meditated around the mountains where this complex is situated. The
                        temple itself is named after where it is thought the Buddha practiced asceticism. It was a
                        wonderfully designed place, with decorative architecture and a lot of nature. Kiều made sure to
                        enlighten me with the histories of each of the temples we visited. We also went to the Hương
                        Tích Cave, which felt like entering a dragon, it's a great experience.

                        There's a huge green statue of the Buddha in there along with a plethora of others. Every temple
                        there had a statue of the Buddha somewhere. As well, there were candles and the smell of incense
                        present—brings me back to some family gatherings. We stopped last at the Thiên Trù Pagoda, which
                        is the central temple of the complex, where I observed people worshipping. Most people here who
                        were doing so were silently meditating. Some made offerings which represented showing respect to
                        the Three Jewels. They would light incense, light a candle then give an offering of some sort of
                        fruit or flowers. Kiều made a big distinction to me, however, that Buddhists do not worship
                        the Buddha, nor any other deities. This is different from Christianity where one would worship
                        God.
                        Buddhists only highly regard the Buddha and follow his teachings.

                    <p>
                        On May 23, I went with Kiều to celebrate Vesak, which takes place on the day of the full moon in
                        during that month. Kiều was pretty excited to show me this one as Vesak is a celebration of
                        the Buddha's birth and enlightenment. I went with Kiều to observe the celebration at night time
                        at
                        the Trấn Quốc Pagoda, as that lined up with our schedules. However, people celebrate Vesak for
                        the whole day. It was around 8:20 PM there, which was a few hours after the sunset, so we
                        couldn't see much, but that was outshined by the myriad of lights in the area. Most noticeable
                        was the huge lotus lantern.
                    </p>

                    <p class="caption">
                        <caption>The huge (huge!) lotus flower.</caption>
                    </p>
                    <p>Kiều told me a while ago that lotus flowers are a key symbol in Buddhism. Around the time that we
                        went to the Hương Temple, we stopped by to visit a lotus pond in Xuân Đỉnh. She told me how
                        important the lotus was in Buddhism by showing how they grow. The water in the pond was pretty
                        muddy, evident by how my shoes looked after the visit. However, the lotus grew in this area
                        despite the conditions. Therefore, the lotus represents enlightenment, as well as the suffering
                        in <i>samsara</i>, or life, death and rebirth, that the person endured. Even though the lotus is
                        rooted in the muddy waters of suffering, it blossoms clear and beautifully in the end. This
                        makes lotus such a fitting symbol during Vesak especially, to represent the blooming of the one
                        Buddhists base their life around through his teachings.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>There were also many chanting, meditating and giving offerings. Paired with the multitude of
                        lanterns over the waters gave the place a very calming atmosphere. It felt like the birth of
                        something new—refreshing. This was my last day here so achieving a feeling like this was
                        amazing. It allowed me to reflect on all that I learned in this trip, the new knowledge that
                        came out of it that I will be able to use for the rest of my life.</p>
